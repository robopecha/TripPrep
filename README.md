A travel preparation app following my personal system that I created as a pen & paper version years ago. 
In addition to being on top of all things travel the app lets you look up what other users packed for a specific trip and lets you also share your packing list publicly. 
A main focus is on usability and simplicity.

The app is not finished, I am still adding new features and improving existing ones.

I am using Express.js and MongoDB for the back-end and React and TailwindCSS for the Front-end.
