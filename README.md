# TripPrep

TripPrep is an app based on my personal travel prep system,<br />
that allows me to keep track of everything that happens before my trip.<br />
This way I can leave the house relaxed, knowing that everything is done and I forgot nothing.

I am using three sheets of paper:<br />
One for everything that needs to be done before the trip,<br />
one for everything I need to buy,<br />
and one for all the things I am going to pack.

A digital version of this system is not only convenient, because you can add things on the go,
it also adds more possibilities:<br />
A packing mode that allows you to simply check off the packing list items while packing.<br />
And the option to share your packing list with other users and to look at others' packing lists for inspiration.

Your packing list will only be shared publicly after you mark it as "Everything is packed!" and set your trip to public.<br />
Only your To Pack list will be seen by others. Nobody will see your To Do and To Buy lists.

I am still improving this app.<br />
If something is not working perfectly, I am probably just working on it.<br />
I recommend using it in Chrome on desktop.
